# Java Interview

This repository represents the technical portion of the java interview at CACIB's Digital Factory.

The test is a live coding session. The test case was taken from codingdojo.

The tasks are as follows:

- Clone the current repository;
- Add JUnit 4.11 to the maven dependencies in "test" scope;
- Develop tests and implemention of the the RPN calculator according to the spec below (RPNCalculator.java has a TEST_DATA field with the data to validate the calculator);
- Think aloud :)

## RPN Calculator

An RPN calculator computes expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation.

An RPN expression or postfix expression is one of the following :

- a number X, in wich case the value of the expression is that of X,
- a sequence of form E1 E2 OP where E1 and E2 are RPN expressions and OP is an arithmetic operation.

Samples :

```
20 5 /        => 20/5 = 4
4 2 + 3 -     => (4+2)-3 = 3
3 5 8 * 7 + * => ((5*8)+7)*3 = 141
```

Add the SQRT operation :

```
9 SQRT => âˆš9 = 3
```

```

Add the MAX operation :

```

5 3 4 2 9 1 MAX => MAX(5, 3, 4, 2, 9, 1) = 9
4 5 MAX 1 2 MAX _ => MAX(4,5) _ MAX(1,2) = 10

```

```
